# The Software Essentialist Program

## Overview

This repo has my work from the Software Essentialist program. It includes solutions to exercises and small projects that build on core software engineering principles.

## Purpose

Iâ€™m doing this program to sharpen my technical skills and work better with engineers. Building my technical knowledge is part of my growth as a senior IC-track product manager who consistently delivers business value.

## Why It Matters

Software is always changing, but the fundamentals stay the same. This program strengthens my understanding of those fundamentals. Itâ€™s part of my commitment to becoming a unicorn PM ðŸ¦„ â€”combining deep expertise in business, design, and engineering to solve tough problems and help teams build valuable products.
